# We are given a binary tree (with root node root), a target node, and an integer value `K`.
#
# Return a list of the values of all nodes that have a distance K from the target node.  The answer can be returned in any order.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, K = 2
# Output: [7,4,1]
# Explanation:
# The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5)
# have values 7, 4, and 1.
#
# Note that the inputs "root" and "target" are actually TreeNodes.
# The descriptions of the inputs above are just serializations of these objects.
#
# Note:
#
# The given tree is non-empty.
# Each node in the tree has unique values 0 <= node.val <= 500.
# The target node is a node in the tree.
# 0 <= K <= 1000.
