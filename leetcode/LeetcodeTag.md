# Leetcode tag
For better categorizing

Redo all tags with **Redo** since I didn't manage to solve the issue without any help.
TODO: Add the general thoughts of solving each problem

# By topic
Linked list: 


Q1 Two Sum: two pointers, easy
Q2 Add two numbers: linked list, **Redo**, medium
3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: two pointers, medium

12. Integer to Roman    
	Each bit in integer would not affect each other to transform to roman, so just transfer it one by one according to the bit

13. Roman to Integer
	Reverse of **Q12** Integer to roman, increment all roman from left to right excecpt for those input[i] < input[i+1]  (eg: IV,XL), these are for 4s and 9s.

14. Longest Common Prefix
	**Easy** find the shortest string, iterate every string's char at index i, use enumerate for getting i in one line

15. 3Sum
	Same as **Q14** 2sum

16. 3Sum Closest
	Same ide as **Q14** **Q15** 3sum/ 2sum

17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number
	**Redo**, use a lot of function programming and itertools (filter, itertools.product) to solve this question in a smart way.

18. 4Sum:
	**Redo**, same as **Q14** **Q15** **Q16** based on 3sum and 2sum. Need to do a lot of corner case check to avoid duplicate items, overloop and TLE

19. Remove Nth Node From End of List:
	**Redo**, **linked list**, should do it in one loop, use recursion to get the position of node that needs to be removed

20. Valid Parentheses:
	one-pass, same to most parentheses problems, use stack to check parentheses matches

21. Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists:
	**Redo**, **linked list**, Recursion on linked list

22. Generate Parentheses
	**Redo**, **linked list**, use recursion to generate all combinations of parentheses.

23. Merge k Sorted Linked Lists  
	**Redo**, **linked list**, use priority queue to always find the linked list with smallest value

24. Swap Nodes in Pairs:
	**Redo**, **linked list**, understand the pattern of swapping and change the "next" pointer of each node accordingly

25. Swap Nodes in k-group:
	**Redo**, **linked list**, use a counter to find every reverse group, use recursion to do the swap from last group to first group
