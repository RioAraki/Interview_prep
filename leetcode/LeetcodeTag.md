Redo all tags with **Redo** since I didn't manage to solve the issue without any help.
TODO: Add the general thoughts of solving each problem

# By topic
Linked list: 


Q1 Two Sum: two pointers, easy
Q2 Add two numbers: linked list, **Redo**, medium
3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: two pointers, medium

12. Integer to Roman    
	Each bit in integer would not affect each other to transform to roman, so just transfer it one by one according to the bit

13. Roman to Integer
	Reverse of **Q12** Integer to roman, increment all roman from left to right excecpt for those input[i] < input[i+1]  (eg: IV,XL), these are for 4s and 9s.

14. Longest Common Prefix
	**Easy** find the shortest string, iterate every string's char at index i, use enumerate for getting i in one line

15. 3Sum
	Same as **Q14** 2sum

16. 3Sum Closest
	Same ide as **Q14** **Q15** 3sum/ 2sum

17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number
	**Redo**, use a lot of function programming and itertools (filter, itertools.product) to solve this question in a smart way.

18. 4Sum:
	**Redo**, same as **Q14** **Q15** **Q16** based on 3sum and 2sum. Need to do a lot of corner case check to avoid duplicate items, overloop and TLE

19. Remove Nth Node From End of List:
	**Redo**, **linked list**, should do it in one loop, use recursion to get the position of node that needs to be removed

20. Valid Parentheses:
	one-pass, same to most parentheses problems, use stack to check parentheses matches

21. Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists:
	**Redo**, **linked list**, Recursion on linked list

22. Generate Parentheses
	**Redo**, **linked list**, use recursion to generate all combinations of parentheses.

23. Merge k Sorted Linked Lists  
	**Redo**, **linked list**, use priority queue to always find the linked list with smallest value

24. Swap Nodes in Pairs:
	**Redo**, **linked list**, understand the pattern of swapping and change the "next" pointer of each node accordingly

25. Swap Nodes in k-group:
	**Redo**, **linked list**, use a counter to find every reverse group, use recursion to do the swap from last group to first group

32. Longest Valid Parentheses
	**string**, **stack**, **dp**, dp: 1d array, dp[i] records longest valid parentheses end at S[i]

	make sure left ( always > 0. when meet right parenthesis, valid count = valid parenthesis count from previous parenthesis + 2
	We want to recursively fond previous valid parenthesis until it hits beginning of dp.

33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
	**Redo**, **binary search**, Set lo and hi, binary search to find the point where rotate begins. Binary search to find where target locates by comparing rotating point and middle index.

34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
    **Redo**, **binary search**, do binary search two time, first time for start point, second time set mid = (lo+hi)//2+1 for right biased mid to find end point

35. Search Insert Position    
	**binary search**
	for better efficiency, always check if the element checked is exactly at the position we want to insert before doing next step of binary search

	or check all elements bigger than the target you want to insert, though its o(n) compare to binary search's o(log(n))

36. Valid Sudoku
	**2d array**, **hash table**
	Count each row, column and square, use filter, and set - list compare to exclude dot, and check duplicate

	Or give every position three unique formats corresponding to row, col and square. Use a set to save and check duplicate
	- '4' in row 7 is encoded as "(4)7".
	- '4' in column 7 is encoded as "7(4)".
	- '4' in the top-right block is encoded as "0(4)2".

37. Sudoku Solver
	**TODO**
	This question is too big, I prefer to do some review on csc384 before solving it

38. Count and Say
	 **string**
	 write a helper function given the previous input, return the next count and say output.

39. Combination Sum
	**dp**, **dfs**, **backtrack**
	use 1d array length equal to range(target), saved all combination sums up to the value of each index. Return the dp[-1]

	looks like there are some other ways like dfs, backtracking, will research more.

40. Combination Sum ii
    **dp**, **dfs**, **backtrack** **TODO: Use backtrack to solve**
    Similar but different from 39, all candidates could be used once this time. Use the recursion way (dfs) to deal with it,
    Most solutions from 39 could also be applied on 40 with little modificationb

41. First Missing Positive
    **array**
    Tricky, **run in O(n) time and uses constant extra space**. The first missing positive must be in range[1, len(nums)+1].
    Loop through the list, if nums[index] != index + 1 (eg: nums[0] != 1), swap nums[nums[index]-1] with nums[index] until
    nums[index] is in its right place or some value not in 1 ~ len(nums) is returned.
    Then loop the list again and check the first element does not equal to index + 1.

872. Leaf-similar Trees
	**Tree**, easy, Write a function to return all leaves, then compare both trees

873. Length of Longest Fibonacci Subsequence
	**Redo**, medium, could use brute force with optimization or dp with 2d array saved data.


874. Walking Robot Simulation
	**Redo**, easy, algorithm is easy, but need to smartly implemnet rotation and obstacle.


875. Koko Eating Bananas
	**Redo**, medium, math?, No very smart algorithm to solve this one. Use binary search to quickly find the value of eat speed, since the search space is relatively small (1, max(piles)) it would be reasonably fast

886. Possible Bipartition
	**Bipartite**, **graph**, **dfs**, **Redo**
	Draw a graph (each people as key, dislike relation as value), regard people as vertices, dislike relation as edges. Unable to do the partition if we could find cycle with odd edges.

887. Super Egg Drop
	**Redo**, **DP**, 
	Saved data: 2d array, rows -> eggs; columns -> nums of moves (floors?); value -> num of trials

	Transform equaltion: superEggDrop(N,x) = 1 + max(superEggDrop(N-1, x), superEggDrop(N, K-x))


888. Uncommon Words from Two Sentences
	String, easy, collections.counter do a lot of jobs. Combine two strings together would make the algo much more efficient


889. Spiral Matrix III
	**Redo**, medium, 2d array, simulate the spiral isnt easy, efficient turn like 874
