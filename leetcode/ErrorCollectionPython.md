# Error collection

A list of common syntax/ logical error I made when solving leetcode question by python. My goal is to achieve "one time accepted" for all easy/ medium level questions with python without any assist (like checking api). This requires the proficiency to python, think carefully about all possible corner cases and a quick mind to think about the best and accurate algorithms.

So far I could solve most of questions with 3-10 attempts, and a lot of times my answer causes TLE (time limit exceeded) which indicates my answer is correct but inefficiency. In order to have a better understand about my performance and where I could improve most, here I want to create this collection recording all different failing types and I have met and how often do I face to them.

## Error table

| Failure types   | nums    | Met in  |
| :-------------: |:-------:| :-----: |
| wrong index     | 1       | 830 |
| variable misuse | 1       | 830 |
| corner case     | 1       | 830 |
