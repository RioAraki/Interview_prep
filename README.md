### Leetcode 

Goal:

- Solve the first 150 questions
- Solve questions with different difficulties based on different topics
- Solve latest released questions routinely

Language:

- Python: easiest, fastest,
- C++: more useful since A lot of jobs I pursue requires C++ skills


[Topics](https://github.com/RioAraki/Interview_prep/blob/master/topic/topics.md)

A lot of solutions are a mix of multiple topics, one question could also have different solutions based on different methods. The following lists are based on my own solution and experience.

- Sorting / search
  - Heap sort
  - Quick sort
  - Binary search
  - Two pointer  
    Q: 1
- Hash tables  
  Q: 1
- Linked list  
  Leetcode provides specific API for linked list data structure, so you do not need to implement a linked list even though it is good to do so. Most linked list refers to singly linked list  
  Q: 2
- Stack and Queue

- Tree
  - Tree traverse
  - BST
  - AVL tree
  - Red black trees
  - B trees
  - Heaps

- Recursion

- Greedy

- Divide and conquer 

- Dynamic programming 



   
- Graph  
  A lot of methods from graph theory like BFS and DFS can be applied widely in various questions. 

  - BFS (breath first search)
  - DFS (depth first search)
  - MST (Medium spanning tree)
  - Disjoint sets

- Network flow
  - Single source shortest paths
  - All-pairs shortest paths
  - Maximum flow
  
- Linear programming

- Maths
  - Geometry
  - Bit manipulation
