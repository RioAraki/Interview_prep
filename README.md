# Interview_prep
My plan to prepare for 2019 full time interview algorithm questions.

## General idea
Review most CLRS as guidence (CSC263 + CSC373) + most leetcode questions (easy + medium, some hard maybe?) covering all topics for practice 

## CLRS
[Notes](https://github.com/RioAraki/Interview_prep/blob/master/CLRS/clrs.md)


## Leetcode 
Mainly work with python language, try to solve with C++ as well if I have time.

1. By [Topics](https://github.com/RioAraki/Interview_prep/blob/master/topic/topics.md)
    - brute force 

    - all sorting/ search
      - Heapsort
      - Quicksort

    - Hashtables
    - Linked list
    - Stack and Queue

    - Tree
      - Tree traverse
      - BST
      - AVL tree
      - Red black trees
      - B trees

    - dynamic programming 
     - divide and conquer 
     - recursion
    - Greedy

    - Binomial heaps
    - Disjoint sets

    - DFS/ BFS
    - MST (Medium spanning tree)
    - Network flow
     - Single source shortest paths
     - All-pairs shortest paths
     - Maximum flow

    - Linear programming

    - Maths
