# Interview_prep
My preparation for 2019 full time interview

## General idea
Review most CLRS as guidence (CSC263 + CSC373) + most leetcode questions (easy + medium, some hard maybe?) for practice.

## CLRS
[Notes](https://github.com/RioAraki/Interview_prep/blob/master/CLRS/clrs.md)


## Leetcode 
Mainly work with python language, try to solve with C++ as well if I have time.

### 1. By data structure (graph, tree, queue, hashtable, linked list, array, string, ...) and algorithms (DP, dfs, bfs, two pointers, union find, divide and conquer, trie, recursion, ... )

### 2. First 150 questions as it covers most topics in algorithm

### 3. Weekly contest for routinely practice
